# NOTES
- I just designed for cl screens for now. I neeed to tweak the elements a bit for it to look pleasing on other screens. 
- Responsiveness: I need to use media queries as there ar some conditions I need to specify that I can't do via bootstrap. 
- Generally, I've done the basic design. I just need to finish the detailing. I hope yo don't mind.
