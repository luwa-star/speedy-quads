# NOTES
I've fixed all the issues stated before.
-- I increased the interactivity of the page my adding an eventlistener to make the background change color everytime a color paltte is clecked to enable the customer know what the color looks like on a larger screen.
Basically, its just to help the customer make preinformed decisions befpre making an order.
